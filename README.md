# Creating global climate uniqueness and climate velocity maps 

This was an early version of code that was adapted into the [BON-in-a-Box](https://github.com/GEO-BON/boninabox-pipelines) scripts [`climateVelocity`](https://github.com/GEO-BON/boninabox-pipelines/blob/e82654c6ad0bfbe8113ba156d6ffb186bd982991/scripts/Block3/climateVelocity.jl) and [`climateUniqueness`](https://github.com/GEO-BON/boninabox-pipelines/blob/e82654c6ad0bfbe8113ba156d6ffb186bd982991/scripts/Block3/climateUniqueness.jl)
